# 🪺 WorkNest – The Ultimate Web-based Productivity Nest (🚧 In Progress)

**WorkNest** is your modular, draggable productivity workspace — crafted for creators, coders, students, and productivity lovers who crave a futuristic but friendly command center.

From timers to task management, from AI assistants to design tools — all in a **glassmorphic UI** that *feels like Jarvis, works like Notion*, and moves like Figma.

> ⚠️ **This project is still in progress. Estimated completion: 2–3 days. Stay tuned for full feature drops!**
